# 01-Introduction

For this assignment I am writing some code to help me answer the following questions:

* What is your name?
* What is your favorite game?
* What concerns do you have about this class?
* What are you excited about (in general)?
* What is your stackoverflow.com user number?
* What is the URL to your github.com profile?

I will also need to make sure that I have completed these requiremetns:

* Create an account on stack overflow
* Create an account on github
* Download and install python
* Download and install visual studio code
* Download git

Some more detailed instructions are as follows:

1. I forked the assignment repository over to my own and then cloned it into my VSC
2. Then I edited the LICENSE to show that I open my code to the public.
3. Next I edited main.py to print the answers to all the questions above.
4. Finally I commit and pushed my final code to my github
